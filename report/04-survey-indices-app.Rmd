# FISHERY-INDEPENDENT INDICES OF ABUNDANCE

## CANADIAN SURVEYS

### HECATE STRAIT ASSEMBLAGE SURVEY

A series of multi-species groundfish bottom trawl surveys was conducted in
Hecate Strait in May-June of 1984, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998,
2000, 2002, and 2003 @westrheim1984, @fargo1984, @fargo1988, @wilson1991,
@hand1994, @workman1996, @workman1997, @choromanski2002)  (Figure
\@ref(fig:survey-maps-hs-msa). The results up to 2000 were reported in the 2001
assessment [@sinclair2001] and results from 2002 and 2003 were presented in the
2005 assessment [@sinclair2005].

The original design of this survey assigned fishing locations by 10 fm depth
intervals within a 10 nm grid of Hecate Strait. The survey was post-stratified
for the purpose of calculating an abundance index for Pacific Cod
[@sinclair2000]. The post stratification used 10 fm depth intervals for the
entire survey area, thereby treating each depth interval as a single stratum.

The Hecate Strait Assemblage survey was designed as a systematic
fixed-station survey. Despite attempts to apply post-sampling stratification,
this approach had high survey variance [@sinclair2007]. In 2004 the Hecate
Strait Assemblage survey was discontinued in favour of the Hecate Strait
Synoptic survey (described below).

### HECATE STRAIT SYNOPTIC SURVEY

The Hecate Strait synoptic groundfish bottom trawl survey is part of
a coordinated set of long-term surveys that together cover the continental
shelf and upper slope of most of the BC coast (Figure
\@ref(fig:survey-maps-syn-hs). The Hecate Strait synoptic survey has been
conducted during May-June, in odd years since 2005. All the synoptic surveys
follow a random depth stratified design. The survey area is divided into 2 km
by 2 km blocks and each block is assigned to one of four depth strata based on
the average bottom depth in the block. The four depth strata for the Hecate
Strait survey are 10--70m, 70--130m, 130--220m, and 220--500m. Each year blocks
are randomly selected within each depth strata. For this survey and the other
synoptic surveys discussed below, the relative allocation of blocks amongst
depth strata was determined by modeling the expected catches of groundfish and
determining the target number of tows per stratum that would provide sufficiently
precise catch rate data for as many species as possible.

### QUEEN CHARLOTTE SOUND SYNOPTIC SURVEY

The Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) synoptic groundfish bottom trawl survey has
been conducted in July--August in 2003, 2004, and in odd years since 2005
(Figure \@ref(fig:survey-maps-syn-qcs). The four depth strata for the QCS
survey are 50--125m, 125--200m, 200--330m, and 330--500 m. Each year blocks are
randomly selected within each depth strata. In addition, for the purposes of
allocating blocks, the QCS survey is divided into northern and southern spatial
strata.

### WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND SYNOPTIC SURVEY

The West Coast Vancouver Island synoptic bottom trawl survey was first
conducted in 2004 and is conducted in alternating (even-numbered) years on
a chartered commercial trawler (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-maps-syn-wcvi)). The
survey area is off the west coast of Vancouver Island from approximately 49
$^\circ$  12$^\prime$ to 50 $^\circ$ 36$^\prime$ North latitude and
approximately 124 $^\circ$  48$^\prime$ to 128 $^\circ$  30$^\prime$ West
longitude. The southern boundary is contiguous with the Canada/U.S. boundary.
The survey has a single aerial stratum in Pacific Fishery Management Area
regions 3C and 3D separated into four depth strata: 50--125m; 125--200m;
200--330m; and 330--500m. Approximately 150 to 180 4 km^2^ blocks are selected
randomly among the four depth strata when conducting each survey.

### SWEPT AREA ANALYSIS

For all Canadian surveys, a swept area estimate of biomass in any year $y$ was
obtained by summing the product of the CPUE and the area surveyed across the
surveyed strata $i$:

\begin{equation}
  B_y = \sum_{i=1}^kC_{y_i}A_i=\sum_{i=1}^kB_{y_i}
  (\#eq:sweptareabiomass)
\end{equation}

where
$C_{y_i}$ = mean CPUE density (kg/km^2^) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$,
$A_i$ = area of stratum $i$ (km^2^),
$B_{y_i}$ = biomass of Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$, and
$k$ = number of strata.

CPUE ($C_{y_i}$) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$ was calculated as
a density in kg/km^2^ by

\begin{equation}
  C_{y_i}=\frac{1}{n_{y_i}} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_{y_i}} \frac{W_{y_i,j}}{D_{y_i,j}w_{y_i,j}}
  (\#eq:sweptareacpue)
\end{equation}

where
$W_{y_i,j}$ = catch weight (kg) for Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$ and tow $j$,
$D_{y_i,j}$ = distance travelled (km) by tow $j$ in stratum $i$ for year $y$,
$w_{y_i,j}$ = net opening (km) by tow $j$ in stratum $i$ for year $y$, and
$n_{y_i}$ = number of tows in stratum $i$.

The variance of the survey biomass estimate $V_y$ for Pacific Cod in year $y$
was calculated in kg^2^ as follows:

\begin{equation}
  V_y=\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{\sigma_{y_i}^2A_i^2}{n_{y_i}}=\sum_{i=1}^kV_{y_i}
  (\#eq:sweptareavariance)
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{y_i}^2$ is the variance of the CPUE in $kg^2/km^4$ for year $y$ in
stratum $i$, $V_{y_i}$ is the variance of Pacific Cod in stratum $i$ for year $y$,
and where $\sigma_{y_i}^2$ was obtained from bootstrapped samples (see below).

The CV for Pacific Cod for each year $y$ was calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
  (CV)_y=\frac{{V_y}^{1/2}}{B_y}
  (\#eq:sweptareacv)
\end{equation}

where $(CV)_y$ is the CV for year $y$.

One thousand bootstrap replicates with replacement were constructed from the
survey data to estimate bias corrected 95% confidence intervals for each survey
year [@efron1982]. The resulting values are shown in Table
\@ref(tab:surv-canadian-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:surv-canadian).

## NMFS TRIENNIAL SURVEY (IN CANADIAN WATERS)

A relative abundance index was developed for Area 3CD from data from the
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Triennial survey operated off the
lower half of Vancouver Island.

###  Data selection

Tow-by-tow data from the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) triennial
survey covering the Vancouver INPFC (International North Pacific Fisheries
Commission) region were provided by Mark Wilkins (NMFS, pers. comm.) for the
seven years that the survey worked in BC waters (Table
\@ref(tab:surv-tri-strata-table), Figure \@ref(fig:tri-tows))). These tows were
assigned to strata by the NMFS, although the size and definition of these
strata have changed over the life of the survey. The NMFS survey database also
identified in which country the tow was located. This information was plotted
and checked against the accepted Canada/USA marine boundary: all tows appeared
to be appropriately located with respect to country, based on the tow start
position Figure \@ref(fig:tri-tows))). The NMFS designations were accepted for
tows located near the marine border.

All usable tows had an associated median net width (with 1--99% quantiles) of
13.4 (11.3-15.7) m and median distance travelled of 2.8 (1.4--3.5) km, allowing
for the calculation of the area swept by each tow. Biomass indices and the
associated analytical CVs for Pacific Cod were calculated for the total
Vancouver INPFC region and for each of the Canadian- and US-Vancouver
sub-regions, using appropriate area estimates for each stratum and year. Strata
that were not surveyed consistently in all seven years of the survey were
dropped from the analysis, allowing the remaining data to provide a comparable
set of data for each year.

```{r surv-tri-strata-table, warning=FALSE}
tri_str <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data/triennial-strata.csv"))
names(tri_str) <- gsub("_1", "", names(tri_str))
tri_to_shade <- which(tri_str$Shade == 1)
tri_str$Shade <- NULL
for (i in seq_along(names(tri_str))) {
  tri_str[,i][is.na(tri_str[,i])] <- ""
}
tri_str$`Stratum No.`[tri_to_shade] <- paste0(tri_str$`Stratum No.`[tri_to_shade], "*")
knitr::kable(tri_str,
    caption = "Number of tows by stratum and by survey year for the NFMS triennial survey. Strata denoted with an asterisk have been excluded from the analysis due to incomplete coverage across the seven survey years or were from locations outside the Vancouver INPFC area.",
    booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "", format = "pandoc") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
```

The stratum definitions used in the 1980 and 1983 surveys were different than
those used in subsequent surveys, particularly in Canadian waters. Consequently, these indices were not used in the 3CD stock assessment. The tow density was much higher in US waters
although the overall number of tows was approximately the same for each
country. This occurs because the size of the total area fished in the INPFC
Vancouver area was about twice as large in Canadian waters than in US waters.
Note that the northern extension of the survey has varied from year to year
(Figure \@ref(fig:tri-tows)), but this difference has been compensated for by
using a constant survey area for all years and assuming that catch rates in the
unsampled areas were the same as in the sampled area.

A reviewer from NOAA for Yellowtail Rockfish in 2014 noted that a number of the
early Triennial survey tows had been deemed "water hauls" (catching no fish or
invertebrates) and should be discarded. The tows used to estimate relative
Pacific Cod biomass exclude these water haul tows.

###  TRIENNIAL SURVEY METHODS

When calculating the variance for this survey, it was assumed that the variance
and CPUE within any stratum were equal, even for strata that were split by the
Canada/USA border. The total biomass within a stratum that straddled the border
was split between the two countries by the ratio of the relative area within
each country:

\begin{equation}
B_{y_{i,c}}=B_{y_{i}}\frac{A_{y_{i,c}}}{A_{y_{i}}}
(\#eq:tri1)
\end{equation}

where $A_{y_{i,c}} =$ area (km^2^) within country *c* in year *y* and stratum
*i* and *B* represents biomass.

The variance *V* for that part of stratum *i* within country *c* was
calculated as being in proportion to the ratio of the square of the area
within each country *c* relative to the total area of stratum *i*. This
assumption resulted in the CVs within each country stratum being the
same as the CV in the entire stratum:

\begin{equation}
V_{y_{i,c}}=V_{y_{i}}\frac{A_{y_{i,c}}^{2}}{A_{y_{i}}^{2}}.
(\#eq:tri2)
\end{equation}

The partial variance for country *c* was used in instead of the total
variance in the stratum when calculating the variance for the total biomass in
Canadian or American waters.

The biomass estimates and the associated standard errors were adjusted to
a constant area covered using the ratios of area surveyed. This was required to
adjust the Canadian biomass estimates for 1980 and 1983 to account for the
smaller area surveyed in those years compared to the succeeding surveys. he 1980
and 1983 biomass estimates from Canadian waters were consequently multiplied by
the ratio 1.24 (= 9166 km^2^ / 7399 km^2^) to make them equivalent to the
coverage of the surveys from 1989 onwards.

Biomass estimates were bootstrapped for 1000 random draws with
replacement to obtain bias-corrected [@efron1982] 95% confidence
intervals for each year and for three area categories (total Vancouver
region, Canadian-Vancouver only and US-Vancouver only) based on the
distribution of biomass estimates and using the above equations.

Catch and effort data for strata \(i\) in year \(y\) yield catch per unit
effort (CPUE) values\({U_{yi}}\). Given a set of data \(\left\{
{{C_{yij}},{E_{yij}}} \right\}\) for tows\(j = 1, \ldots ,{n_{yi}}\),

\begin{equation}
{U_{yi}} = \frac{1}{{{n_{yi}}}}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{n_{yi}}} {\frac{{{C_{yij}}}}{{{E_{yij}}}}},
\end{equation}

where \({C_{yij}}\) = catch (kg) in tow \(j\), stratum \(i\), year \(y\);
\({E_{yij}}\) = effort (h) in tow \(j\), stratum \(i\), year \(y\); and
\({n_{yi}}\)  = number of tows in stratum \(i\), year \(y\).

CPUE values \({U_{yi}}\) convert to CPUE densities \({\delta _{yi}}\) (kg/km2) using:

\begin{equation}
{\delta _{yi}} = \frac{1}{{vw}}{U_{yi}},
\end{equation}

where \(v\) = average vessel speed (km/h) and
\(w\) = average net width (km).

Alternatively, if vessel information exists for every tow, CPUE density can be
expressed

\begin{equation}
{\delta _{yi}} = \frac{1}{{{n_{yi}}}}\,\,\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{{n_{yi}}} {\,\frac{{{C_{yij}}}}{{{D_{yij}}{w_{yij}}}}},
\end{equation}

where \({C_{yij}}\) = catch weight (kg) for tow \(j\), stratum \(i\), year \(y\);
\({D_{yij}}\) = distance travelled (km) for tow\(j\), stratum\(i\), year\(y\);
\({w_{yij}}\) = net opening (km) for tow\(j\), stratum\(i\), year\(y\); and
\({n_{yi}}\)  = number of tows in stratum\(i\), year\(y\).

The annual biomass estimate is then the sum of the product of CPUE densities and bottom areas across \(m\) strata:

\begin{equation}
{B_y} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^m {{\delta _{yi}}{A_i}}  = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^m {{B_{yi}}},
\end{equation}

where \({\delta _{yi}}\)  = mean CPUE density (kg/km2) for stratum \(i\), year \(y\);
  \({A_i}\) = area (km2) of stratum\(i\);
  \({B_{yi}}\)  = biomass (kg) for stratum\(i\), year\(y\); and
  \(m\) = number of strata.

The variance of the survey biomass estimate \({V_y}\) (kg^2^) follows:

\begin{equation}
{V_y} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^m {\frac{{\sigma _{yi}^2A_i^2}}{{{n_{yi}}}}\,}  = \,\,\,\sum\limits_{i = 1}^m {{V_{yi}}},
\end{equation}

where \(\sigma _{yi}^2\)  = variance of CPUE density (kg^2^/km^4^) for
stratum \(i\), year \(y\) and
\({V_{yi}}\)  = variance of the biomass estimate (kg^2^) for
stratum\(i\), year \(y\).

The coefficient of variation (CV) of the annual biomass estimate for year \(y\) is

\begin{equation}
C{V_y} = \frac{{\sqrt {\,{V_y}} }}{{{B_y}}}.
\end{equation}

### TRIENNIAL SURVEY RESULTS

Relative biomass estimates and confidence intervals are shown in Table
\@ref(tab:surv-trien-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:tri-fig9). Pacific Cod are
characterized with most catches taken along the shelf edge and in the deep gully
entering Juan de Fuca Strait (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:tri-tows)). A more
consistent biomass estimate was obtained by excluding deep strata that were not
covered in the earlier surveys. Figure \@ref(fig:tri-fig8) shows that this
species was mainly found between 57 and 256 m (1 and 99% quantiles of bottom
depth), with infrequent observations at depths up to 326 m which means that the
deeper strata (>367 m) are not needed to monitor Pacific Cod. Note that the deep
strata which were not used in the biomass estimation are included in Figure
\@ref(fig:tri-fig8).
