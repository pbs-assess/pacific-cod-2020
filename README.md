# pacific-cod-2020
Draft update to the Pacific Cod assessment for Areas 3CD and 5ABCD. 

This is a simple "turn of the crank" on the base case models with updated data streams.

## Getting started

**Create the following folders:**

* data/generated

* data/pcod-cache

* data/results

* presentations

* presentations/figures (can get rid of this one later when I look for the code that uses it)

Some of these folders might make themselves but I can't remember which ones.

### Quick start

**1. Put these files directly into the data folder:**

* cpue-historic.rds

* cpue-modern.rds

**2. Put this files into the data/pcod-cache folder:**

* pacific-cod.rds

**3. Put these files into the data/generated folder**

* all_surveys.csv

* cpue-predictions-historical.csv

* cpue-predictions-modern.csv

* cpue-re-preds.rda

* cpue-re-preds-noint.rda

* cpue-models-pcod-historic.rds

* cpue-models-pcod-modern.rds


OR

### Make the data objects yourself (especially if you want to check the data queries)
