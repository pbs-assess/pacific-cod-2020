# pacific-cod-2020
Draft update to the Pacific Cod assessment for Areas 3CD and 5ABCD. 

This is a simple "turn of the crank" on the base case models with updated data streams.

## Getting started

**Create the following folders:**

* data/generated

* data/pcod-cache

* data/results

* presentations

* presentations/figures (can get rid of this one later when I look for the code that uses it)

Some of these folders might make themselves but I can't remember which ones
