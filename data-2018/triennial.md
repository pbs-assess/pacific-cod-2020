B.  Trawl Surveys

    1.  Introduction

This appendix summarises the derivation of relative Pacific Cod (PAC)
abundance indices from the following bottom trawl survey:

-   National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Triennial survey operated
    off the lower half of Vancouver Island (Section B.3);

    2.  Analytical methods

Catch and effort data for strata  in year  yield catch per unit effort
(CPUE) values. Given a set of data  for tows,

Eq. B.1 ,

where = catch (kg) in tow , stratum , year ;\
= effort (h) in tow , stratum , year ;\
= number of tows in stratum , year .

CPUE values  convert to CPUE densities  (kg/km^2^) using:

Eq. B.2 ,

where = average vessel speed (km/h);\
= average net width (km).

Alternatively, if vessel information exists for every tow, CPUE density
can be expressed

Eq. B.3 ,

where = catch weight (kg) for tow , stratum , year ;\
= distance travelled (km) for tow, stratum, year;\
= net opening (km) for tow, stratum, year;\
= number of tows in stratum, year.

The annual biomass estimate is then the sum of the product of CPUE
densities and bottom areas across strata:

Eq. B.4 ,

where = mean CPUE density (kg/km^2^) for stratum , year ;\
= area (km^2^) of stratum;\
= biomass (kg) for stratum, year;\
= number of strata.

The variance of the survey biomass estimate (kg^2^) follows:

Eq. B.5 ,

where = variance of CPUE density (kg^2^/km^4^) for stratum , year ;\
= variance of the biomass estimate (kg^2^) for stratum, year .

The coefficient of variation (CV) of the annual biomass estimate for
year is

Eq. B.6 .

3.  NMFS Triennial Trawl Survey

    1.  Data selection

Tow-by-tow data from the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
triennial survey covering the Vancouver INPFC (International North
Pacific Fisheries Commission) region were provided by Mark Wilkins
(NMFS, pers. comm.) for the seven years that the survey worked in BC
waters (Table B.1; 1980: Figure B.1; 1983: Figure B.2; 1989: Figure B.3;
1992: Figure B.4; 1995: Figure B.5; 1998: Figure B.6; 2001: Figure B.7).
These tows were assigned to strata by the NMFS, but the size and
definition of these strata have changed over the life of the survey
(Table B.2). The NMFS survey database also identified in which country
the tow was located. This information was plotted and checked against
the accepted Canada/USA marine boundary: all tows appeared to be
appropriately located with respect to country, based on the tow start
position (Figure B.1 to Figure B.7). The NMFS designations were accepted
for tows located near the marine border.

All usable tows had an associated median net width (with 1-99%
quantiles) of 13.4 (11.3-15.7) m and median distance travelled of 2.8
(1.4-3.5) km, allowing for the calculation of the area swept by each
tow. Biomass indices and the associated analytical CVs for Pacific Cod
were calculated for the total Vancouver INPFC region and for each of the
Canadian- and US-Vancouver sub-regions, using appropriate area estimates
for each stratum and year (Table B.2). Strata that were not surveyed
consistently in all seven years of the survey were dropped from the
analysis (Table B.1; Table B.2), allowing the remaining data to provide
a comparable set of data for each year (Table B.3).

Table B.1. Number of tows by stratum and by survey year for the NFMS
triennial survey. Strata coloured grey have been excluded from the
analysis due to incomplete coverage across the seven survey years or
were from locations outside the Vancouver INPFC area (Table B.2).

The stratum definitions used in the 1980 and 1983 surveys were different
than those used in subsequent surveys, particularly in Canadian waters
(Table B.3). Therefore, the 1980 and 1983 indices were scaled up by the
ratio (9166 km^2^ / 7399 km^2^ = 1.24) of the total stratum areas
relative to the 1989 and later surveys so that the coverage from the
first two surveys would be comparable to the surveys conducted from 1989
onwards. The tow density was much higher in US waters although the
overall number of tows was approximately the same for each country
(Table B.3). This occurs because the size of the total area fished in
the INPFC Vancouver area was about twice as large in Canadian waters
than in US waters (Table B.3). Note that the northern extension of the
survey has varied from year to year (Figure B.1 to Figure B.7), but this
difference has been compensated for by using a constant survey area for
all years and assuming that catch rates in the unsampled areas were the
same as in the sampled area.

Table B.2. Stratum definitions by year used in the NMFS triennial survey
to separate the survey results by country and by INPFC area. Stratum
definitions in grey are those strata which have been excluded from the
final analysis due to incomplete coverage across the seven survey years
or because the locations were outside the Vancouver INPFC area.

A reviewer from NOAA for Yellowtail Rockfish in 2014 (DFO 2015) noted
that a number of the early Triennial survey tows had been deemed "water
hauls" (catching no fish or invertebrates) and should be discarded. The
tows used to estimate relative Pacific Cod biomass (summarised in
Table B.3) exclude these water haul tows.

INPFC Vancouver region separated by the international border between
Canada and the United States. Strata 18N, 28N, 37, 38 and 39 (Table B.2)
were dropped from this analysis as they were not consistently conducted
over the survey period. All strata occurring in the Columbia INPFC
region (17S and 27S; Table B.2) were also dropped.

2.  Methods

The data were analysed using the equations in Section B.1. When
calculating the variance for this survey, it was assumed that the
variance and CPUE within any stratum were equal, even for strata that
were split by the Canada/USA border. The total biomass within a stratum
that straddled the border was split between the two countries by the
ratio of the relative area within each country:

Eq. B.7 ,

where = area (km^2^) within country *c* in year *y* and stratum *i*.

The variance for that part of stratum *i* within country *c* was
calculated as being in proportion to the ratio of the square of the area
within each country *c* relative to the total area of stratum *i*. This
assumption resulted in the CVs within each country stratum being the
same as the CV in the entire stratum:

Eq. B.8 .

The partial variance for country *c* was used in Eq. B.5 instead of the
total variance in the stratum when calculating the variance for the
total biomass in Canadian or American waters. CVs were calculated as in
Eq. B.6.

The biomass estimates Eq. B.4 and the associated standard errors were
adjusted to a constant area covered using the ratios of area surveyed
provided in Table B.3. This was required to adjust the Canadian biomass
estimates for 1980 and 1983 to account for the smaller area surveyed in
those years compared to the succeeding surveys. he 1980 and 1983 biomass
estimates from Canadian waters were consequently multiplied by the ratio
1.24 (= 9166 km^2^ / 7399 km^2^) to make them equivalent to the coverage
of the surveys from 1989 onwards.

Biomass estimates were bootstrapped for 1000 random draws with
replacement to obtain bias-corrected (Efron 1982) 95% confidence
intervals for each year and for three area categories (total Vancouver
region, Canadian-Vancouver only and US-Vancouver only) based on the
distribution of biomass estimates and using the above equations.

3.  Results

Pacific Cod (PAC) are characterised with most catches taken along the
shelf edge and in the deep gully entering Juan de Fuca Strait (e.g.,
Figure B.1 and Figure B.2). A more consistent biomass estimate was
obtained by excluding deep strata that were not covered in the earlier
surveys (Table B.2). Figure B.8 shows that this species was mainly found
between 57 and 256 m (1 and 99% quantiles of \[bottom\_depth\]), with
infrequent observations at depths up to 326 m which means that the
deeper strata (\>367 m) are not needed to monitor PAC. Note that the
deep strata which were not used in the biomass estimation are included
in Figure B.8.

^1^ Bootstrap failed for US Vancouver in 1989

Pacific Cod biomass estimates in Canadian waters were higher in the
three early surveys (1980 to 1989) than in US waters (Figure B.9;
Table B.4). The final four surveys (1992 to 2001) in both areas were
generally lower than for the first three surveys. The relative error
estimates are variable, with the lowest relative error occurring at 0.18
in 1998 for Total Vancouver and the greatest at 0.66 in 1980 for the US
Vancouver stratum (Table B.4). The relative error estimates for the
sub-divided national strata tend to be higher than for Total Vancouver
in the same years. Note that the bootstrap estimates of relative error
do not include any uncertainty with respect to the ratio expansion
required to make the 1980 and 1983 survey estimates comparable to the
1989 and later surveys. Therefore, it is likely that the true
uncertainty for this series is greater than estimated.

Over 50% of the 664 tows used for biomass estimation captured PAC (342
tows or 51.5%). The largest tow was 804 kg in 1989. The proportion of
tows which contained Pacific Cod ranged from 39% to 71% in Canadian
waters and between 39% and 57% in US, with no apparent trend
(Figure B.10).
